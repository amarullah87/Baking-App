# Baking-App
The task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacity’s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. We will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.  The JSON file contains the recipes' instructions, ingredients, videos and images that we need to complete this project. Don’t assume that all steps of the recipe have a video. Some may have a video, an image, or no visual media at all.
